            <h3 class="mb-3">Hi, I'm Duha the creator of Artora!</h3>
            <p>
                I built Artora because I believe in the power of design and the people behind it. Whether you're a client looking for talent, or a designer wanting to be discovered — I wanted to create a space where those connections can happen easily and beautifully.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a student and a self-taught developer, I combined what I love — design, creativity, and code — into this platform. Artora is my way of supporting designers while learning and growing through this journey myself.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">My Vision</h3>
            <p>
                I want Artora to become a supportive space for creatives. Not too complicated. Not too corporate. Just real people connecting through good work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for stopping by, and I hope Artora helps you find what you're looking for — or at least inspires you to build your own thing too.
